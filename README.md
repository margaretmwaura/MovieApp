# MovieApp
This is an android application that lets the users view the most popular movies and the top rated movies.
The movies are fetched from the The Movie Database(TMDb).
The users can view the trailers as well as the reviews of a particular movie.
The user can add a movie to the favourite list and the favourite movies will be available offline.

## What I will learn
1) Using retrofit to fetch movies from the movie database
2) Using room to store the favourite list of movies
3) Implementing viewModel and livedata architecture
4) Using a viewPager that will help the user navigate from one movie category to the next
5) Using the network broadcast receiver to implement functionalities when there is network connectivity and when there isn't
